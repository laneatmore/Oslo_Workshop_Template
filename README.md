This repository contains scripts used to analyze population differentiation in Atlantic cod using the BAMscorer software program (Ferrari & Atmore et al. 2021). 

## Repo File Structure 
The Analysis_Scripts directory contains three subdirectories, one for each population comparison, which each contain specific scripts used to run the BAMscorer program on the population in question. 

The Figure_Scripts directory contains R scripts used to create figures for the paper, including PCA plots and a histogram of SNP loading weights for each population comparison database.
